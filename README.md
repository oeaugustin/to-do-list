# to-do-list
Here I used HTML, CSS, And JavaScript to make a to do list application

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery

I used JQuery to add li's to a ul using the .append() method. I tried to make the styling clean and modern as well

## Lessons Learned:

It was a great learning how to use the append method in this way and it was a good experience to have once I started using ejs templates
